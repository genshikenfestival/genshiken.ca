Genshiken Festival is a one-day convention organized by students from a variety of Ontario University Anime Clubs and brought to you by some of the same organizers as Ākēdo Festival! The Festival features Artist Alleys, Maid Cafe, Performances, and more!

This repository contains the code for the main front-end site used for Genshiken! The website is built in NextJS, Typescript, and Tailwind.

For the development environment, we prefer using `pnpm` as well as Visual Studio Code with the `cspell`, and `prettier` plugins installed. Please enable format on save in VS Code for this project.

## Getting Started

To get started with development:

```bash
# Get all deps.
pnpm install

# Run the NextJS dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the development version of the app!
